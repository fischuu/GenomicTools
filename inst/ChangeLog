LOG of the CHANGES in the package GenomicTools
-----------------------------------------------------
Version with odd last numbers are development versions.
Stable releases have even version numbers:
-----------------------------------------------------
Planned improvements for 0.5:
* Improve the feedback/verboseness of the functions
   - 'We will test for xxx genes possible eQTL' - give here the amount of tested SNPs
* Revisit the print/summary functions, there is also still space for improvements...
* output numbered and estimation of the remaining time (eQTL)
* Sort QTL plots first numerical, then non-numerical
* Progress bar for trans-eQTL and QTL (eQTL)
* Automatic detection for need of transposition of pheno and gex input
* Reduce redundancy between eQTL and QTL

Version 0.5.*:
 
 4: Fixed a coordinate bug in the plot.eqtl bed output
 3: Added the option to add an annotation track to the eQTL plots
 2: BugFix in eQTL function that prevented the median expression to be correctly reported
 1: Added median expression values to the eqtl_dir part for each genotype group

Version 0.4: Release version

Version 0.3.*:
* (6) The getKEGGModule() function had an issue and reported repeatedly same orthologs.
* (5) Added function getKEGGModuleOverview()
* (2) Orthologies are now also extracted from the function getKEGGPathway()
* (1) REGEX for grep of starting and ending lines in getKEGGPathway adjusted

Version 0.2.*:
* (10) Added the function getKEGGinformation() for better KEGG information retrieval

Version 0.2.9.*:
* (1) Bugfix in joinEQTL (rbind issue, in case that no SNPs in gene window)
* (2) Missing detectCores() import added
* (3) seqlength() function added
* (4) MAF option added to eQTL and version dependency  for importVCF increased for critical bugfix 
* (5) Plotting function adjusted to new MAF option
* (6) Warning fixed caused by wrong vectorisation in joinEQTL() function
* (7) gtfToBed() adjusts now the bases to bed-standard by default
* (8) Verbose output of eQTL() adjusted
* (9) Issue fixed in MAF checks, if all genotypes are missing 
* (10) Issue if NaN are present in tests and sig!=NULL is set
* (11) restrictionDigest() function added
* (12) Additional output for restrictionDigest() added
* (13) revcomp() function added

Version 0.2.8:
* Released on Cran

Version 0.2.7 (Developer Version):
* prereadGTF() function added
* importGTF() function can now merge several gtfs into one data table
* importFeatureCounts() function added
* typo in 'importPED()' fixed
* Bug fixed in rearranged()
* QTL does now accept also plain vectors and matrices as input for genotypes
* importGTF issue fixed with auto separation detection from fread()
* improved input checks of importGTF()
* import* functions Deprecated and moved to the new package GenomicTools.fileHandler
* print.qtlRes handles now output without significant results
* bugfix in eqtlDir and eqtlLM (error, if only one SNP is tested)
* Couple of smaller bugfixes
* importVCF moved to GenomicTools.fileHandler
* No empty (=NA or NaN) p.values will be printed anymore in print.eqtl output
* Curtesy feedback for missing URl in getRSLocation
* getRSLocation URL adjusted to new Ensembl server adresses

Version 0.2.6:
* Stable Cran release version

Version 0.2.5:
* KEGG pathways functions added
* Function to 'getRSLocation' added
* Added the cvc option to 'mdr'
* Clarified the NA handling in 'mdr'

Version 0.2.4:
* Dependency versions updated

Version 0.2.3:
* Typo in 'print.mdrEnsemble' fixed

Version 0.2.2:
* Typos fixed

Version 0.2.1:
* Improvements in 'importGFF3':
     - The function uses now fread and handles comment lines in between

Version 0.2:
* Added the importVCF function

Version 0.1.1:
* Changed the asymptotical directional test to be the default for eQTL() and QTL()

Version 0.1:
* First build and initial submission to Cran
