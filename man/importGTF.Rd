\title{
  Import a GTF File
}

\description{
  This function imports a gtf file.
}
\usage{
  importGTF(file, skip = auto, nrow = -1, use.data.table = TRUE, level = "gene",
            features = NULL, print.features=FALSE, merge.feature=NULL,
            verbose=FALSE)
}

\arguments{
  \item{file}{File name of the gtf file.}
  \item{skip}{Rows to skip from the top (usualy the number of header rows.}
  \item{nrow}{Total amount of rows read.}
  \item{use.data.table}{Logical, shall the data.table package be used for importing the GTF file.}
  \item{level}{Filter for the GTF Entry.}
  \item{features}{Feature names to extract from column #9.}
  \item{print.features}{logical, shall a list of availbe features be printed.}
  \item{merge.feature}{The name of the feature to merge the data.}
  \item{class.names}{Vecotr with labels for the merged features.}
  \item{verbose}{Logical, for 'talk-active' output}
}

\details{
  This function imports a gtf file. The features names to be imported are defined in \code{features}, several features are then
  provided as vector. A list of available feature can beprinted, by setting \code{print.features=TRUE}.
  
  The \code{skip} option allows to skip a given number of rows, the default is, however, \code{auto}. In that case, all rows that
  start with the \code{#} symbol are skipped.
  
  In case a set of expression values given in gtf format should be imported and to be merged into a single data table, the feature
  that should be used for merging can be provided to the \code{merge.feature} option. In that case the function expects a folder
  in \code{file} and it will import all gtfs located in that folder and merges them according to the \code{merge.feature} option.
  With the option \code{class.names} a vector of prefixes for the merged features can be provided. If this is kept empty, then the 
  filenames of the gtf will be used instead (without gtf extension).
}
\value{
  A data table of class \code{gtf} containing the columns of the gtf file, including the splitted last column.
